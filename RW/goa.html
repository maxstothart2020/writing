				<FONT size="6"><p>Once upon a time there was a detective.  That detective was named Jeff and he was very nervous.  The reason that Jeff was so nervous was because his next mission was to explore the caretaker’s closet!!!  No one goes even remotely near it.  David the vice principal said that once a child strolled in by mistake and was forgotten.  He says that at night you can still hear him screaming behind the shutters.  The shed door has no key and the principle has asked for a detective agency to investigate the shed to stop David going hysterical.  </p>

<p>David showed me where the shed was and to my surprise he produced a key and unlocked the door.  If I had been anywhere else I would have contradicted him but I was so fearful that I didn’t even think! When I went in I realised that the closet was actually a torture chamber illuminated with scary red light David looked scarier than ever.  My pulse was racing, my lungs were heaving as David turned into the old caretaker’s ghost.  
Aah I cried “I’m gonna die!  Help me. then I stopped the ghost was tangible I could actually touch him which ment….</p>

<p>I could kung-fu him. I lashed out and the ghost whacked face first into the ground, I then hit him with a powerful kick and the ghost disappeared.  I looked around.  My hoopes couldn’t be higher.  I had killed a ghost.  Then all my hope went away and I sat on the ground.  When I killed the ghost I killed the only chance I had of getting out.  The ghost had the key.  Then I heard a drip.  I didn’t even notice at first, then I heard another.  I turned around and saw for the 1st time that on the other side of the room was a gigantic flood gate.  Which started to open.  I thought I was going to die, but then. [Now this the part in the story when the hero escapes but in this story there are many twists and turns.  He might not, who knows?] I remembered that this was a torture chamber which means that there must be gunpowder somewhere.  I could make a bomb.</p>  

	<p>I grabbed a handful of gunpowder and covered an electric chair in it. I put the chair by the door and plugged it in.  the door blew up and I was free!!! But as I said there was a catch.  When I blew up the door it blew up the floodgate and all the water  came rushing out.  It was lunchtime and all the teachers were in the staffroom.  The staffroom just happened to be in front of the caretaker’s closet.  Basically what i’m saying is the staffroom and all the teachers got washed away.  I was happy because even though I had washed away the staffroom, that will stop ghosts torturing kids. As a detective I will have lots more adventures but that is another story.</p>

	<p>A long way away in the middle of the sea all the teachers were angry although they weren’t teachers then they were evil caretaker ghosts.  “How will we torture children now?” asked the school receptionist’s ghost. “We’ll find a way dear we’ll find a way.”Moo he haha.</p>
