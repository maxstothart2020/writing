So let&rsquo;s get started.</span></p><h1 class="c0 c8" id="h.7e5mh3o54v23"><span class="c3"></span></h1><h1 class="c0" id="h.6m6ou8w0k9n"><span class="c3">What were the jobs for animals in ww1?</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Even though there were hundreds of jobs and animals in ww1 I&#39;m just going to list a few. &nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c0 c5" id="h.xlgw40mgs8nt"><span class="c2"></span></h2><h2 class="c0" id="h.bej12ta421kw"><span class="c2">Dogs</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Dogs were incredibly useful in ww1. They were used as sentries, (dogs who are trained to alert soldiers of gas attacks and ambushes.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">couriers, (They pass reports and data, to big for birds to carry, to the rest of the soldiers or other places)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">nurses, (these brave dogs ran through the battlefields giving medical supplies to injured soldiers.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">pest control(Because the soldiers lived in trenches rats lived everywhere, these dogs found, killed and retrieved rats to help soldiers) and pets.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c5" id="h.6iy2k5ewf1zx"><span class="c2"></span></h2><h2 class="c0" id="h.i78tv1yjea6z"><span class="c2">Horses</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Horses were also incredibly useful. They were mainly used for transport. By transport, I mean carrying supplies, wounded soldiers, pigeons and sometimes even weapons(there are pictures of horses with machine guns on their backs.</span></p><h2 class="c0 c5" id="h.w49ktmfr4beo"><span class="c2"></span></h2><h2 class="c0" id="h.xztgw2zb5zx4"><span class="c2">Pigeons</span></h2><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Pigeons are mainly used for conveying messages to different parts of the army and long-distances. Soldiers would tie messages to one of the pigeon&rsquo;s legs and send them off. &nbsp;For example, some pigeons were used to fly messages over the black sea to Europe. &nbsp;When I say surveillance I think spies and gadgets, not pigeons but they worked. &nbsp;In fact, in ww1 pigeons were one of the best forms of surveillance around(amongst human spies of course). &nbsp;Soldiers would put little mini cameras on the front of them and send them off to survey enemy armies. &nbsp;The cameras were self clicking so they would automatically take photos every once in a while. &nbsp; Because they used film, when they got home they had to develop it.</span></p></body></html>
